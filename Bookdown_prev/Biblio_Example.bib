  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous randomized trial, we found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was not inferior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis at 1 year.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the 5-year outcomes of PCI compared with CABG for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 600 patients with unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis to undergo PCI with a sirolimus-eluting stent (n = 300) or CABG (n = 300). The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE: a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization) and compared on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: At 5 years, MACCE occurred in 52 patients in the PCI group and 42 patients in the CABG group (cumulative event rates of 17.5\% and 14.3\%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.27; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84 to 1.90; p = 0.26). The 2 groups did not differ significantly in terms of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke as well as their composite (8.4\% and 9.6\%; HR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 1.52; p = 0.66). Ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization occurred more frequently in the PCI group than in the CABG group (11.4\% and 5.5\%, respectively; HR: 2.11; 95\% CI: 1.16 to 3.84; p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: During 5 years of follow-up, our study did not show significant difference regarding the rate of MACCE between patients who underwent PCI with a sirolimus-eluting stent and those who underwent CABG. However, considering the limited power of our study, our results should be interpreted with caution.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this randomized study was to compare sirolimus-eluting stenting with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for patients with unprotected left main (ULM) coronary artery disease.
BACKGROUND: CABG is considered the standard of care for treatment of ULM. Improvements in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with use of drug-eluting stents might lead to similar results. The effectiveness of drug-eluting stenting versus surgery has not been established in a randomized trial.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, 201 patients with ULM disease were randomly assigned to undergo sirolimus-eluting stenting (n = 100) or CABG using predominantly arterial grafts (n = 101). The primary clinical end point was noninferiority in freedom from major adverse cardiac events, such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and the need for target vessel revascularization within 12 months.
RESULTS: The combined primary end point was reached in 13.9\% of patients after surgery, as opposed to 19.0\% after PCI (p = 0.19 for noninferiority). The combined rates for death and myocardial infarction were comparable (surgery, 7.9\% vs. stenting, 5.0\%; noninferiority p {$<$} 0.001), but stenting was inferior to surgery for repeat revascularization (5.9\% vs. 14.0\%; noninferiority p = 0.35). Perioperative complications including 2 strokes were higher after surgery (4\% vs. 30\%; p {$<$} 0.001). Freedom from angina was similar between groups (p = 0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ULM stenosis, PCI with sirolimus-eluting stents did not show noninferiority [corrected] to CABG at 12-month follow-up with respect to freedom from major adverse cardiac events, which is mainly influenced by repeated revascularization, whereas for hard endpoints, [corrected] PCI results are favorable. A longer follow-up is warranted. [corrected]},
